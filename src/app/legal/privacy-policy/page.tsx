        <br />
        <br />
        3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
        <br />
        <br />
        In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it
        is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do
        so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to
        provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual
        obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate

        If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.
        <br />

        We may process your information if you have given us specific permission
        (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific
        purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e.,
        implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.
        <br />
        <br />- In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under
        applicable law to process your information without your consent,
        including, for example:
        <br />- If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and
        consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
        <br />- For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
        <br />- For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
        <br />- If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is

        <br />- For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and
        communicating with next of kin
        <br />- If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been,
        is, or may be victim of financial abuse
        <br />- If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent
        would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and
        the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a
        breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a
        province
        <br />- If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant,
        court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
        <br />- If it was produced by an individual in the course of their
        employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent
        with the purposes for which the information was produced
        <br />- If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or
        literary purposes
        <br />- If the information is publicly available and is specified by the
        regulations
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        5. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?
        <br />
        <br />
        In Short: We are not responsible for the safety of any information that

        Services, but are not affiliated with, our Services.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or
        mobile applications and/or contain advertisements from third parties
        that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites,
        services, or applications. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee
        regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss
        or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or
        applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website,
        service, or application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot
        guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third
        parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this
        privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and
        security practices and policies of any third parties, including other

        contact them directly to respond to your questions.
        <br />
        <br />
        6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?
        <br />
        <br />
        In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a
        social media account, we may have access to certain information about
        you.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
        third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X
        logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
        information about you from your social media provider. The profile
        information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
        concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
        list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to
        make public on such a social media platform.
        <br />
        <br />
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
        described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you
        on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are
        not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
        third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their
        privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
        personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
        their sites and apps.
        <br />
        <br />
        7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
        <br />
        <br />
        In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill
        the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required
        by law.
        <br />
        <br />
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
        of time in which users have an account with us.
        <br />
        <br />
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
        <br />
        <br />
        8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
        <br />
        <br />
        In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system
        of organizational and technical security measures.
        <br />
        <br />
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
        organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
        personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
        or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within
        a secure environment.
        <br />
        <br />
        9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?
        <br />
        <br />
        In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children
        under 18 years of age.
        <br />
        <br />
        We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children
        under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal
        information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least
        18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to
        such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal
        information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we
        will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
        delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we
        may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
        samyiyunjia@gmail.com.
        <br />
        <br />
        10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?
        <br />
        <br />
        In Short: Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some
        regions, such as Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access
        to and control over your personal information. You may review, change,
        or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country,
        province, or state of residence.
        <br />
        <br />
        In some regions (like Canada), you have certain rights under applicable
        data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access
        and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request
        rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your
        personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v)
        not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain
        circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing
        of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting
        us by using the contact details provided in the section &quot;HOW CAN
        YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&quot; below.
        <br />
        <br />
        We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable
        data protection laws.
        <br />
        <br />
        Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process
        your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent
        depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your
        consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by
        contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section
        &quot;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&quot; below.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
        processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will
        it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
        reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
        <br />
        <br />
        Account Information
        <br />
        <br />

        we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud,
        troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal
        terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may

        11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
        <br />
        <br />
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting
        you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
        about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
        stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
        DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
        DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
        online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
        inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
        notice.
        <br />
        <br />
        California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser
        DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal
        standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to
        them at this time.

        determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
        our system. We will only use personal information provided in your
        request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
        However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already
        maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information
