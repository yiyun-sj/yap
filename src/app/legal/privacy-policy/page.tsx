        and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device
        characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs,

        We do not collect any sensitive information.
        <br />
        <br />
        2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
        <br />
        <br />
        We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending
        on how you interact with our Services, including:
        <br />
        - To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise manage
        user accounts. We may process your information so you can create and log
        in to your account, as well as keep your account in working order.
        <br />
        - To deliver and facilitate the delivery of services to the user. We may
        process your information to provide you with the requested service.
        <br />
        - To respond to user inquiries/offer support to users. We may process
        your information to respond to your inquiries and resolve any feedback
        or issues you might have with the requested service.

        We may process your information when we believe it is necessary to
        improve our Services, products, and your experience.
        <br />
        <br />
        3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
        <br />
        <br />
        We may process your information if you have given us specific permission
        (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific
        purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e.,
        implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. In some
        exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to
        process your information without your consent, including, for example:
        <br />
        - If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent
        cannot be obtained in a timely way
        <br />
        - For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
        <br />
        - If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is
        necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
        <br />
        - For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating
        with next of kin
        <br />
        - If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is,
        or may be a victim of financial abuse
        <br />
        - If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
        compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the
        collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach
        of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
        <br />
        - If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court
        order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
        <br />
        - If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary
        purposes
        <br />
        - If the information is publicly available and is specified by the
        regulations
        <br />
        <br />
        4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
        <br />
        <br />
        We do not share your personal information with any third parties.
        <br />
        <br />
        5. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?
        <br />
        <br />
        The Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or
        mobile applications and/or contain advertisements from third parties
        that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites,
        services, or applications. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee
        regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss
        or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or
        applications. The inclusion of a link to a third-party website, service,
        or application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee
        the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any
        data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice.
        We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices
        and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services,
        or applications that may be linked to or from the Services. You should
        review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to
        respond to your questions.
        <br />
        <br />
        6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
        <br />
        <br />
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us to keep your personal information for longer than the period
        of time in which users have an account with us.
        <br />
        <br />
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
        <br />
        <br />
        7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
        <br />
        <br />
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
        organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
        personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
        or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within
        a secure environment.
        <br />
        <br />
        8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?
        <br />
        <br />
        We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children
        under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal
        information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least
        18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to
        such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal
        information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we
        will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
        delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we
        may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
        information.yap@gmail.com.
        <br />
        <br />

        rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your
        personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v)

        us at information.yap@gmail.com.
        <br />

        data protection laws.
        <br />
        <br />

        your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent
        depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your
        consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by
        contacting us at information.yap@gmail.com.
        <br />
        <br />

        processing before its withdrawal nor when applicable law allows, will it
        affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance
        on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
        <br />
        <br />
        Account Information. If you would at any time like to review or change
        the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:
        <br />
        - Log in to your account settings and update your user account.
        <br />

        <br />
        Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or
        delete your account and information from our active databases. However,
        we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud,
        troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal
        terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
        <br />
        <br />
        California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser
        DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal
        standard for recognizing or honouring DNT signals, we do not respond to
        them at this time.
        <br />
        <br />

        authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny a request
        from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been

        authority to make the request. However, if we cannot verify your

        your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.
        <br />
        <br />
