        Yap is licensed to You (End-User) by Sam Jia (&quot;Licensor&quot;), for
        use only under the terms of this License Agreement.
        <br />
        <br />
        By downloading the Licensed Application from Apple&apos;s software
        distribution platform (&quot;App Store&quot;) and Google&apos;s software
        distribution platform (&quot;Play Store&quot;), and any update thereto
        (as permitted by this License Agreement), You indicate that You agree to
        be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this License Agreement,
        and that You accept this License Agreement. App Store and Play Store are
        referred to in this License Agreement as &quot;Services.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        The parties of this License Agreement acknowledge that the Services are
        not a Party to this License Agreement and are not bound by any
        provisions or obligations with regard to the Licensed Application, such
        as warranty, liability, maintenance and support thereof. Yap, not the
        Services, is solely responsible for the Licensed Application and the
        content thereof.
        <br />
        <br />
        This License Agreement may not provide for usage rules for the Licensed
        Application that are in conflict with the latest Apple Media Services
        Terms and Conditions and Google Play Terms of Service (&quot;Usage
        Rules&quot;). Yap acknowledges that it had the opportunity to review the
        Usage Rules and this License Agreement does not conflict with them.
        <br />
        <br />
        Yap when purchased or downloaded through the Services, is licensed to
        You for use only under the terms of this License Agreement. Licensor
        reserves all rights not expressly granted to You. Yap is to be used on
        devices that operate with Apple&apos;s operating system
        (&quot;iOS&quot;) or Google&apos;s operating system
        (&quot;Android&quot;).
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        1. THE APPLICATION
        <br />
        <br />
        YAP (&quot;Licensed Application&quot;) is a piece of software created to
        provide a platform for people to rate and share opinions on any
        appropriate topics and/or items and customized for iOS and Android
        mobile devices (&quot;Devices&quot;).
        <br />
        <br />
        The Licensed Application is not tailored to comply with
        industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and
        Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act
        (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws,
        you may not use this Licensed Application. You may not use the Licensed
        Application in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
        (GLBA).
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        2. SCOPE OF LICENSE
        <br />
        <br />
        2.1 This license will also govern any updates of the Licensed
        Application provided by Licensor that replace, repair, and/or supplement
        the first Licensed Application, unless a separate license is provided
        for such update, in which case the terms of that new license will
        govern.
        <br />
        <br />
        2.2 You may not share or make the Licensed Application available to
        third parties (unless to the degree allowed by the Usage Rules, and with
        Yap&apos;s prior written consent), sell, rent, lend, lease or otherwise
        redistribute the Licensed Application.
        <br />
        <br />
        2.3 You may not reverse engineer, translate, disassemble, integrate,
        decompile, remove, modify, combine, create derivative works or updates
        of, adapt, or attempt to derive the source code of the Licensed
        Application, or any part thereof (except with Yap&apos;s prior written
        consent).
        <br />
        <br />
        2.4 You may not copy (excluding when expressly authorized by this
        license and the Usage Rules) or alter the Licensed Application or
        portions thereof. You may create and store copies only on devices that
        You own or control for backup keeping under the terms of this license,
        the Usage Rules, and any other terms and conditions that apply to the
        device or software used. You may not remove any intellectual property
        notices. You acknowledge that no unauthorized third parties may gain
        access to these copies at any time. If you sell your Devices to a third
        party, you must remove the Licensed Application from the Devices before
        doing so.
        <br />
        <br />
        2.5 Violations of the obligations mentioned above, as well as the
        attempt of such infringement, may be subject to prosecution and damages.
        <br />
        <br />
        2.6 Licensor reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of
        licensing.
        <br />
        <br />
        2.7 Nothing in this license should be interpreted to restrict
        third-party terms. When using the Licensed Application, You must ensure
        that You comply with applicable third-party terms and conditions.
        <br />
        <br />
        3. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

        <br />
        <br />
        3.2 You acknowledge that it is Your responsibility to confirm and
        determine that the app end-user device on which You intend to use the
        Licensed Application satisfies the technical specifications mentioned
        above.

        <br />

        identify you.
        <br />
        <br />
